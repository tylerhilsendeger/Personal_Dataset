This graph is a representation of how homeruns became more popular in the MLB throughout the 1900's. It shows the correltion between hits(x-axis) and homeruns(y-axis) for three different players throughout their careers. The first player, and the one who had the least strong correlation between hits and homeruns, is Rogers Hornsby. He played from 1915 to 1937, and won two MVP awards. The next player with a slightly stronger correlation is Ted Williams. He is often called the best hitter ever, and won two MVP awards from 1939 to 1960. The last player, and the one whose hits led to the most home runs, is named Ken Griffey Junior. He played from 1989 to 2020, and is a great example of the shift toward homeruns in the MLB, as he is a similar caliber player as the other two, but yields more homeruns in relation to hits.
